# handover
A simple project to share updates with work colleagues.

Connects to a database and allows users with access to modify existing records. Results are displayed as a simple webpage.
Allows users to upload or replaced an existing image on the front page.

I have used a nice little script by https://github.com/Rouji >> https://github.com/Rouji/single_php_filehost as a tempory filler for image uploads. Will probably replace this with my own code at a later date.
